# tech-blog-project

## Description

The purpose of this project was to create a CMS-style tech blog website where a user is able to create an account, make a blog post, and leave comments on existing blog posts. I wanted to make it so that users would have a convenient space to write about their tech thoughts and ideas and be able to interact with those of their peers. I designed the application so that a user is prommpted to log in or sign up. Once that is decided and completed, the user brought to a dashboard where they can create their own post. The home page displays multiple blog posts from multiple users. In order to accomplish all this, I required the use of models, routes, and controllers. I also used Handlebars, Express, Sequelize, and MySQL2. The bulk of what I learned through completing this project was how routes interact with different aspects of the application. I also solidified my knowledge of Handlebars organization, controllers, and MVC.
